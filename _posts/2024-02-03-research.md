Our research portfolio is driven by real-world challenges that stand to benefit from machine learning approaches. Our goal is to spark interdisciplinary work, with application domains that are dictated by the need for support. Colleagues from the University of Edinburgh are always welcome to reach out directly to the lab director to explore cases for advice or collaborative projects.

Past and current work related to the lab ranges from financial markets, data privacy and policing to public health and the physical sciences. As such, our research interests are broad and focussed on where suitable methodology has the potential to solve interesting problems.
